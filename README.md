# JS Workshop Weekend: ES6 + React

```
git clone
npm install       # install all modules
npm test          # single run of tests
npm watch:test    # watch tests on file changes
```

some additional learnings
1. create grouped-katas-spec.js to see if test setup is working at all
2. exclude node_modules for faster indexing
3. uncle bob -> clean code angucken
4. add './node_modules/.bin' to PATH
5. use 'babel src/grouped-katas.js' to see what gets generated
